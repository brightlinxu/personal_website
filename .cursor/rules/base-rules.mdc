<always>
Always take the long term scalable solution.
Always consider the 2nd or 3rd best solution to a problem.
Always think about addressing bugs from a fundamental level.
Always use easily human readable variable names.
Always consider scalability with large input sizes.
Always write code in a way that maximizes type safety and compile-time error detection to minimize runtime errors.
Always import with absolute paths instead of relative paths.
Always use Tailwind CSS variables for theme colors (e.g. `bg-background`, `text-foreground`) instead of hardcoded dark mode modifiers (e.g. `dark:bg-black`). If a variable doesn't exist, create a semantic one in `src/index.css`.
</always>
<never>
Never solve a problem with a quick or "simple" fix. 
Never produce a change with a "copy-paste" style snippet as the first approach.
Never attempt a drop-in solution first.
Never address issues, requests, or bugs with shitty hot-fixes.
Never use short variable names less than 4 characters.
Never use emojis.
Never attempt to run code with a terminal command.
</never>

<suggestions>
If tool calls or file edits continue to fail, relinquish control to the user to debug.
Backwards compatability is not necessary.
It is always okay to write code that will require changes across a whole file or even across the whole codebaseif the change supports long term dev and readability.
Writing tests is not necessary unless requested.
Assume all code will be run on a single threaded for simplicity.
Write code in a style that is easy to navigate with an IDE/VSCode/Jetbrains so devs can cmd+click variables and functions.
If we are writing code that follows a well documented pattern, design, or package that already exists, let me know so I can conduct more research and see if there are existing solutions that could benefit my code. For example, I previously was attempting to implement a ton of custom wrappers around the raw TS Websocket library, only to find out later this has already been solved by Socket.io.
Avoid solutions that rely on try/catch fallback mechanisms. Allow errors to propogate with useful messages so devs can debug.
Don't add comments describing the action you just performed. Only add comments that describe the code.

<typescript>
If the code is typscript, the following must be adhered to:
- all variables must be typed
- do not just import * garbage
- try to use classes or enums wherever possible to guaranteed structured variables
- do not use semicolons
- use # syntax for private variables in classes
- for functions, always use () => {} syntax unless necessary
</typescript>
